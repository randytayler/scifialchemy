# Sci-Fi Alchemy
An HTML5 game for JS13KGames 2021. Mix and match elements to create famous science fiction movies, TV shows, and characters.

There are a total of 100 elements to be created, which include 13 movies, and dozens of shows and characters.

Lots of code taken from https://xem.github.io/, including https://xem.github.io/js1k19/miniSynth/ and https://github.com/xem/miniDragAndDrop.

Note that desvg.html isn't part of the game, but is a tool that smooshes SVGs down into a tiny encoding that the game reconstructs into SVGs. The tool has some very specific requirements.

Use whatever you like, but I doubt you'll like much. :)
