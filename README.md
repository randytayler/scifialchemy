# scifialchemy
An HTML5 game for JS13KGames 2021. Mix and match elements to create famous science fiction movies, TV shows, and characters.

Lots of code taken from https://xem.github.io/, including https://xem.github.io/js1k19/miniSynth/ and https://github.com/xem/miniDragAndDrop.

Use whatever you like, but I doubt you'll like much. :)
